**Build System 2.0** is now public and available for all users! Please check out the [documentation here](https://e2b.dev/docs/template) for more details.

## Migrating from the pre-release SDK version (pre 2.3.0)
If you have been using the pre-release version of the SDK, please note that there are some breaking changes in the new version.

The most notable change is that the default user in the template is now `user` and the set user and working directory are persisted to the Sandbox runtime.

If you want to keep your existing template code, simply add the following lines to your template (`fromDockerfile`/`from_dockerfile` handles this automatically):

<CodeGroup>
```ts JavaScript & TypeScript
const template = Template()
    .fromImage("your-image")
    // Switch to root to perform setup steps
    .setUser("root")
    //... steps
    // Switch back to user for the Sandbox runtime
    .setUser("user")
```

```python Python
template = (
    Template()
    .from_image("your-image")
    # Switch to root to perform setup steps
    .set_user("root")
    #... steps
    # Switch back to user for the Sandbox runtime
    .set_user("user")
)
```
